# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

Delving further into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Python, this project explores the fundamental concept of `inheritance`, a cornerstone of OOP that enables one class to inherit properties and methods from another. Similar to how children inherit traits from their parents, inheritance in programming allows for the extension and reuse of existing code, enhancing reusability and efficiency.

Python provides two built-in functions to facilitate working with inheritance:
- **`isinstance(obj, int)`**: Checks if `obj` is an instance of `int` or a class derived from `int`, returning `True` if the condition is met.
- **`issubclass(bool, int)`**: Verifies if one class is a subclass of another, e.g., `issubclass(bool, int)` returns `True` as `bool` is derived from `int`, while `issubclass(float, int)` returns `False` since `float` is not a subclass of `int`.

Throughout this project, I've deepened my understanding of several key concepts, including:
- The awesomeness of Python programming.
- Definitions and roles of superclass, baseclass, or parentclass.
- The nature and utility of subclasses.
- Techniques for listing all attributes and methods of a class or instance.
- Conditions under which an instance can acquire new attributes.
- The process and benefits of class inheritance.
- The definition and implications of multiple base classes.
- Identification of the default class from which all classes inherit.
- Strategies for overriding methods or attributes from the base class.
- Accessibility of inherited attributes or methods to subclasses.
- The purpose and application of inheritance within OOP.
- The appropriate usage of `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super` built-in functions.

## Resources
To support my learning journey, I utilized several resources:
- [Python Documentation on Inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance)
- [Analytics Vidhya on OOP Inheritance](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/inheritance-object-oriented-programming/#:~:text=super()%20function-,What%20is%20Inheritance%20in%20Object%20Oriented%20Programming%3F,known%20as%20the%20Parent%20class.)
- [YouTube Tutorial on Inheritance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8kCdLCi6Lk)

This project has been an insightful exploration into the mechanics and benefits of inheritance in Python, further solidifying my understanding and appreciation of OOP principles.
