In this project, I delved into the basics of Python programming by working with conditionals, loops, and functions. I learned how to use `if`, `if ... else`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, and `range` in conjunction with `while` and `for` loops. Additionally, I developed skills in writing custom functions in Python, gaining an understanding of variable scope, handling tracebacks, and utilizing arithmetic operators.

To complete certain tasks (TASK 2 to TASK 6 and TASK 14), it's necessary to execute the command `chmod u+x filename`, which enables the final checker (checker 7) to perform its validation.

| `10-add.py` | `def add(a, b):` |
| `11-pow.py` | `def pow(a, b):` |
| `12-fizzbuzz.py` | `def fizzbuzz():` |
| `13-insert_number.c` | `listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number);` |
| `101-remove_char_at.py` | `def remove_char_at(str, n):` |
| `102-magic_calculation.py` | `def magic_calculation(a, b, c):` |

### Project Tasks :page_with_curl:

The tasks for this project range from mandatory to advanced, each designed to reinforce different aspects of Python programming:

- **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing:** A Python script that determines if a randomly assigned number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **1. The last digit:** This script assigns a random number and prints its last digit along with its relation to certain conditions.
- **2. Alphabet game:** A script that prints the alphabet in lowercase using a loop and a single print statement.
- **3. Alphabet soup:** Similar to the previous task but excludes the letters `q` and `e`.
- **4. Hexadecimal printing:** Prints numbers from `0` to `98` in both decimal and hexadecimal formats.
- **5. 00...99:** Prints numbers from `0` to `99` with specific formatting requirements.
- **6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials:** Prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
- **7. islower:** A function that checks for lowercase characters.
- **8. To uppercase:** A function that converts a string to uppercase.
- **9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes:** A function that prints and returns the last digit of a number.
- **10. a + b:** A function that adds two integers.
- **11. a ^ b:** A function that computes the power of one number to another.
- **12. Fizz Buzz:** A function implementing the FizzBuzz logic.
- **13. Insert in sorted linked list:** A C function that inserts a number into a sorted linked list.
- **14. Smile in the mirror:** Prints the alphabet in reverse, alternating lowercase and uppercase.
- **15. Remove at position:** Creates a copy of a string with a character at a specific position removed.
- **16. ByteCode -> Python #2:** A Python function that matches a specific bytecode.

This project serves as a foundational step towards mastering Python programming, covering essential concepts and techniques used in software development.
